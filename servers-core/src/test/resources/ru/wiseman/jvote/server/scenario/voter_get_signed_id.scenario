Scenario:
As a Voter I want to stay anonymous when I vote.
To ensure this I need a CEC signed Voter ID which
does not compromise my anonymity.

Given I have a Test1 vote description
When I send 10 randomly generated masked Voter IDs to CEC
Then I receive 1 Voter ID which will be signed
When I send the masks for all Voter IDs except the received one
Then I receive signed masked Voter ID
